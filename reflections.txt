# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used terminal-table, barometer and win32/sound.  I thought a sound beeping as your file loaded up gives you a sense its started and also having basic weather info is always a good idea with your todo list.  The weather gem was very basic..i tried getting others to work but spent a lot of time with not much siccess.  So I went with a very basic one for now,
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1...A method to clear your todo list
  b) Feature 2...A method to change the priority of todo item)inex, priority)

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project? 10 hours perhaps
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?  All of it!
3. What two additional features did you build? Why? As decribed above.  Clearing a list onluy makes sense to me.  Your list will always change.  Also your priorities change daily in life.  So give the option to change them as well.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?  Truly everywhere..i find it very challenging and I am always reviewing old material.
